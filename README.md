Keywords: Dashboard development, data analysis, business problem solving
## Introduction
Marketing campaigns are essential for businesses to engage with customers and drive sales. However, not all campaigns yield the desired outcomes. Companies need to understand what factors influence campaign success and how to allocate resources effectively. By analyzing historical campaign data, businesses can uncover valuable insights to optimize future marketing strategies. This project aims to analyze the Marketing Campaign Performance Dataset to identify key drivers of success, predict campaign outcomes, and recommend actionable strategies for improvement.
## Technologies Used
- Power BI – Data visualization and dashboarding
- PostgreSQL & SQL – Data storage and querying
- DAX – Advanced calculations and analytics
- Python – Data cleaning, transformation, and predictive modeling

## Business Problem
Despite significant marketing investments, many campaigns fall short of their conversion and ROI targets. The primary challenges include:
- Lack of visibility – Difficulty in tracking real-time campaign performance and adjusting strategies accordingly.
- Inefficient resource allocation – Unclear understanding of which campaign parameters drive success, leading to suboptimal budget distribution.
- High acquisition costs – Ineffective targeting and poor channel selection increase customer acquisition expenses.

Methodology
